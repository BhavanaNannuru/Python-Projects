# Python Projects & Hacks

Welcome to my collection of Python scripts that explore the **clever**, the **curious**, and the **unexpected** sides of Python programming.  
This isn’t just a code dump — it’s a growing library of ideas I’ve explored, broken, fixed, and learned from.

## What’s Inside

Scripts that do something **surprising** or **unusual**  
Smart use of built-in Python features  
Focused mini-projects with real logic and clean code  
Useful, fun, or just plain odd experiments

## Why I Made This

I wanted a space to:

- **Learn by building**, not just watching or reading
- Try weird stuff in Python and see what happens
- Keep track of the cool things I discover along the way

Whether it’s a fun automation, an ASCII art generator, or a tiny tool with unexpected behavior — if it makes me think *“Whoa, that’s neat”*, it goes here.
